// DefaultTransport is the default implementation of Transport and is
// used by DefaultClient. It establishes network connections as needed
// and caches them for reuse by subsequent calls. It uses HTTP proxies
// as directed by the $HTTP_PROXY and $NO_PROXY (or $http_proxy and
// $no_proxy) environment variables.

// DefaultMaxIdleConnsPerHost is the default value of Transport's
// MaxIdleConnsPerHost.

// Transport is an implementation of RoundTripper that supports HTTP,
// HTTPS, and HTTP proxies (for either HTTP or HTTPS with CONNECT).
//
// By default, Transport caches connections for future re-use.
// This may leave many open connections when accessing many hosts.
// This behavior can be managed using Transport's CloseIdleConnections method
// and the MaxIdleConnsPerHost and DisableKeepAlives fields.
//
// Transports should be reused instead of created as needed.
// Transports are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.
//
// A Transport is a low-level primitive for making HTTP and HTTPS requests.
// For high-level functionality, such as cookies and redirects, see Client.
//
// Transport uses HTTP/1.1 for HTTP URLs and either HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2
// for HTTPS URLs, depending on whether the server supports HTTP/2,
// and how the Transport is configured. The DefaultTransport supports HTTP/2.
// To explicitly enable HTTP/2 on a transport, use golang.org/x/net/http2
// and call ConfigureTransport. See the package docs for more about HTTP/2.
//
// Responses with status codes in the 1xx range are either handled
// automatically (100 expect-continue) or ignored. The one
// exception is HTTP status code 101 (Switching Protocols), which is
// considered a terminal status and returned by RoundTrip. To see the
// ignored 1xx responses, use the httptrace trace package's
// ClientTrace.Got1xxResponse.
//
// Transport only retries a request upon encountering a network error
// if the request is idempotent and either has no body or has its
// Request.GetBody defined. HTTP requests are considered idempotent if
// they have HTTP methods GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, or TRACE; or if their
// Header map contains an "Idempotency-Key" or "X-Idempotency-Key"
// entry. If the idempotency key value is an zero-length slice, the
// request is treated as idempotent but the header is not sent on the
// wire.
type Transport = originalHttp.Transport

// ProxyFromEnvironment returns the URL of the proxy to use for a
// given request, as indicated by the environment variables
// HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY (or the lowercase versions
// thereof). HTTPS_PROXY takes precedence over HTTP_PROXY for https
// requests.
//
// The environment values may be either a complete URL or a
// "host[:port]", in which case the "http" scheme is assumed.
// An error is returned if the value is a different form.
//
// A nil URL and nil error are returned if no proxy is defined in the
// environment, or a proxy should not be used for the given request,
// as defined by NO_PROXY.
//
// As a special case, if req.URL.Host is "localhost" (with or without
// a port number), then a nil URL and nil error will be returned.
